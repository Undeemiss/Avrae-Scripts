# Avrae-Scripts
A repository containing the source code for all of my custom Avrae scripts.

As a strong believer in open-source methodology, I have opted to open-source all of my work on Avrae snippets. If you are looking to simply use my snippets, rather than modify or read the code, you would probably be better off subscribing to them using [the official Avrae Alias Workshop](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop), rather than copy-pasting them from here!
