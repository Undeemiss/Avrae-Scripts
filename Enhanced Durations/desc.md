Tired of manually calculating how many turns your extended spells and effects should last for? Fret no more! This snippet set adds -mdur and -hdur, which allow you to set the duration of a spell or effect in minutes or hours, respectively, rather than using turns!

My scripts are all open-source! [View the source-code here](https://github.com/Undeemiss/Avrae-Scripts), if you're interested!
